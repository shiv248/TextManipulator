TextManipulator is an expressive, minimalistic, elegant algorithm implemented in Python.  This project is _very_ much a work in progress, as I explore the wonderful world of Python!

## Goals

  - fast!
  - small
  - simple, elegant, explicit
  - small learning curve
  - file explorer
  - GUI
  - ...

## Prerequisets
  - Python 3
  - Texttable

**Python:**

 To install Python go to their [Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) Page
 
**Texttable:**

 Once instalation is done open command prompt

 in CMD type:

```
    pip install texttable
```

## Status

  Generalized status:

  - ✔ lexer
  - ✔ parser
  - ✔ File Explorer
  - ✔ Order by
  - ✔ Print Table
  - ? GUI
  - ? options
  - ? Any More?
